# DelightfulDesktopZoo
A simple application to create desktop pets. Click the top left icon to get started with creating your own, or use the ones included with release.

As of August 2025 I will begin upgrading this project from what it once was!</br>
## Goals:
- Transform into an MVVM architecture
- Switch to an Electron frontend (and learn it in the process)
- More interactions with pets
- Better file management
- Executable
- (Extra) My son will be a default pet.
